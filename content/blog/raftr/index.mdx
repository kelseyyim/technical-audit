  description:
    "The code, overall, is well-written and documented, follows best practices and makes a good use of managed dependencies. However, we found one medium severity issue as well as provided several findings of 'low' and 'informational' levels. In addition, we suggested a few improvements to dependency management and code documentation. Most issues have been addressed by the PoolTogether team and marked as 'fixed' in the report. Two of the findings were not regarded as issues by the PoolTogether team.",
}

Severity Categories
High The issue puts a large number of users’ sensitive
information at risk, or is reasonably likely to lead to
catastrophic impact for client’s reputation or
serious financial implications for client and users.
Medium The issue puts a subset of users’ sensitive
information at risk, would be detrimental for the
client’s reputation if exploited, or is reasonably
likely to lead to moderate financial impact.
Low The risk is relatively small and could not be
exploited on a recurring basis, or is a risk that the
client has indicated is low-impact in view of the
client’s business circumstances.
Informational The issue does not post an immediate risk, but is
relevant to security best practices or Defence in
Depth.
Undetermined The impact of the issue is uncertain.

Executive Summary

Changelog
Quantstamp's objective was to evaluate the repository for security-related issues, code quality, and adherence to specification and best practices.
Possible issues we looked for included (but are not limited to):
• Transaction-ordering dependence
• Timestamp dependence
• Mishandled exceptions and call stack limits
• Unsafe external calls
• Integer overflow / underflow
• Number rounding errors
• Reentrancy and cross-function vulnerabilities
• Denial of service / logical oversights
• Access control
• Centralization of power
• Business logic contradicting the specification
• Code clones, functionality duplication
• Gas usage
• Arbitrary token minting

Methodology
The Quantstamp auditing process follows a routine series of steps:

1. Code review that includes the following
   i. Review of the specifications, sources, and instructions provided to Quantstamp to make sure we understand the size, scope, and functionality of the smart
   contract
   ii. Manual review of code, which is the process of reading source code line-by-line in an attempt to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   iii. Comparison to specification, which is the process of checking whether the code does what the specifications, sources, and instructions provided to Quantstamp
   describe.
2. Testing and automated analysis that includes the following:
   i. Test coverage analysis, which is the process of determining whether the test cases are actually covering the code and how much code is exercised when we run
   those test cases.
   ii. Symbolic execution, which is analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute.
3. Best practices review, which is a review of the smart contracts to improve efficiency, effectiveness, clarify, maintainability, security, and control based on the
   established industry and academic practices, recommendations, and research.
4. Specific, itemized, and actionable recommendations to help you take steps to secure your smart contracts.
   Goals
   Quantstamp Audit Breakdown
   Toolset
   The below notes outline the setup and steps performed in the process of this audit.
   Setup
   Tool Setup:
   • Truffle v5.0.1
   • Ganache v6.4.1
   • Mythril v0.2.7
   • Securify
   Steps taken to run the tools:

6. Installed Ganache: npm install -g ganache-cli
7. Installed the solidity-coverage tool (within the project's root directory): npm install --save-dev solidity-coverage
8. Ran the coverage tool from the project's root directory: ./node_modules/.bin/solidity-coverage
9. Flattened the source code using truffle-flattener to accommodate the auditing tools.
10. Installed the Mythril tool from Pypi: pip3 install mythril
11. Ran the Mythril tool on each contract: myth -x path/to/contract
12. Ran the Securify tool: java -Xmx6048m -jar securify-0.1.jar -fs contract.sol
    Findings
    Potential Bug in Functionality
    Severity: Medium
    Status: Fixed
    Contract(s) affected: Pool.sol
    A lottery participant may decide to buy additional tickets by calling the method more than once. However, the line
    sets the value to which does not depend on ticket purchases made by the user previously.
    Description: buyTickets(...) Pool.sol, L121
    totalDepositNonFixed
    Exploit Scenario: 1. User buys ten tickets by calling buyTickets(10)
13. User would like to buy two additional tickets by calling buyTickets(2)
14. The final number of tickets recorded in the SortitionSumTree instance is 2, not 12
15. At the draw time, the user has less chances to win, which contradicts the specification.
    Likewise, if user buys the same amount of tickets as the first time, they have no change in their chances to win the lottery, but get charged twice for the same number of
    tickets.
    Recommendation: We recommend to either:
16. Fixing the smart contract logic to correctly account for previous purchases by passing the non-fixed value of to
    as in .
    entries[msg.sender].amount
    sortitionSumTrees.set(...) \_value Pool.sol, L121
17. Limiting the number of calls to buyTickets(...) per user so that each participant can only call the method once.
    Unlocked Dependency Versions
    Severity: Low
    Status: Fixed
    Contract(s) affected: Pool.sol, PoolManager.sol
    Unlocked ("fuzzy") dependency versions in project's may result in compiling the project using versions of dependencies that are different from
    the ones that were tested or audited.
    Description: package.json
    The reference in may result in the project using a version of that is not tested to be
    compatible or safe. Example: a contributor updates the code on the branch and introduces a different behaviour or a security
    vulnerability. Since the version is unlocked, upon a next , it could be unknowingly fetched by a developer and used for compiling the
    project.
    Exploit Scenario: CementDAO/Fixidity#master package.json fixidity
    CementDAO/Fixidity master
    yarn install PoolTogether
    PoolTogether
    Likewise, may result in installing a newer version of (e.g., ), which may not necessarily be as compatible
    or safe as the original one.
    openzeppelin-eth": "^2.1.3" openzeppelin-eth 2.1.14
    Recommendation: In project's package.json, lock dependency versions, e.g.:
    "openzeppelin-eth": "2.1.3"
    For GitHub references, use a specific commit rather than a branch name, e.g.:
    "fixidity": "CementDAO/Fixidity#3547a290825d7e255ca2a4226b3ace5301f0f262",
    In order not to rely on an external repository, consider forking the upstream project and referencing the fork instead.
    Centralization of Power
    Severity: Low
    Status: Fixed
    Contract(s) affected: Pool.sol
    Smart contracts will often have variables to designate the person with special privileges to make modifications to the smart contract. However, this
    centralization of power needs to be made clear to the users, especially depending on the level of privilege the contract allows to the owner.
    Description: owner
    The pool owner has the privilege to lock and unlock the smart contract. If the pool owner loses the key, users have no way of getting back their
    contributions, therefore, the lottery can no longer be considered "lossless".
    Exploit Scenario:
    Recommendation: We recommend:
18. Potentially, introducing a mechanism to allow participants to withdraw once has passed but without having to wait for the pool owner to unlock the
    pool.
    lockEndBlock
19. Instead of having the sole owner account, decentralizing control by supporting a multi-signature M-of-N wallet.
    : the PoolTogether team has taken the approach (1). This mitigates the issue since users can (under certain conditions) withdraw their contributions without relying
    on the pool owner to complete the pool. However, users need to be made aware of the following scenario. In case is set to and
    is set to a high value (e.g., several weeks or months), the pool owner can unlock the pool at any time while regular users have no ability to withdraw their funds unless they
    patiently wait for , which can be unrealistic. The recommendation is to make users aware of this possibility and require pool owners to set
    responsibly.
    Update
    allowLockAnytime true lockEndBlock
    lockEndBlock lockEndBlock
    Unlocked Pragma
    Severity: Informational
    Status: Fixed
    Contract(s) affected: Pool.sol, PoolManager.sol, UniformRandomNumber.sol
    Most Solidity files specify in the header a version number of the format . The caret ( ) before the version number implies an
    unlocked pragma, meaning that the compiler will use the specified version , hence the term "unlocked." For consistency and to prevent unexpected behavior in
    the future, it is recommended to remove the caret to lock the file onto a specific Solidity version.
    Description: pragma solidity (^)0.5.0 ^
    and above
    Recommendation: Locking pragma versions, e.g., pragma solidity 0.5.0.
    Gas Usage / for Loop Concerns
    Severity: Informational
    Contract(s) affected: SortitionSumTreeFactory.sol
    Gas usage is a main concern for smart contract developers and users, since high gas costs may prevent users from wanting to use the smart contract. Even
    worse, some gas usage issues may prevent the contract from providing services entirely. For example, if a loop requires too much gas to exit, then it may prevent the
    contract from functioning correctly entirely.
    Description:
    for
    Typical scenarios include denial-of-service attacks when multiple users make too many small contributions, causing the sizes of data structures and loops
    to be too big, leading to exceeding block gas limit restrictions. While many of the computations in the data structure have logarithmic complexity
    which mitigates the issue, unbounded loops are generally not recommended in smart contracts.
    Exploit Scenario:
    SortitionSumTree
    Recommendation: Capping the number of contributors or having the ticket price large enough to de-incentivize having too many participants.
    : The PoolTogether team is aware of the finding, however, does not consider this to be an issue because the number of users is expected to be small (up to ~ ),
    the logarithm of which is even smaller.
    Update 1400
    Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    Severity: Informational
    Contract(s) affected: Pool.sol
    Description: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a situation which an attacker renders a smart contract unusable.
    The token provided in the constructor , in spite of adherence to the interface, may contain malicious behavior, e.g.,
    may intentionally always return . If that is the case, the method may become unusable.
    Exploit Scenario: Pool.sol, L74 IERC20
    transferFrom false buyTickets(...)
    Recommendation: The pool owner needs to verify the token contract to make sure it strictly adheres to the ERC20 specification and does not render the pool unusable.
    : The PoolTogether team is aware of the finding, however, does not consider this to be an issue because the token address is specified once at the
    contract deployment time and then passed into pools created using the given instance.
    Update PoolManager
    PoolManager
    Misusing require()/assert()/revert()
    Severity: Informational
    Status: Fixed
    Contract(s) affected: FixidityLib.sol
    Description: require(), revert(), and assert() all have their own specific uses and should not be switched around.
    • require() checks that certain preconditions are true before a function is run.
    • revert(), when hit, will undo all computation within the function.
    is meant for checking that certain invariants are true. An failure implies something that should never happen, such as integer overflow, has
    occurred.
    • assert() assert()
    Recommendation: Using require(...) for testing input parameters and assert(...) for validating invariants.

20. "… The more they purchase, the greater the chance they have of winning" seems to be violated in the potential bug scenario described above. See "Potential Bug in
    Functionality" for the details.
21. To match the comment "the total amount cannot exceed the max pool size" strictly, Pool.sol, L126, the sign needs to be "less than or equal".
22. There is a scenario when a pool can remain in the locked state indefinitely. In such a case, the lottery is not quite "lossless" since pool participants cannot withdraw their
    contributions. See the "Centralization of Power" note above for the details.
    Status: Fixed
23. PoolManager.sol, L16: some events and their fields are not documented, e.g., it is not clear what page should be like or units of duration.
24. Some methods do not have comments, such as netWinningsFixedPoint24 and grossWinningsFixedPoint24.
25. FixidityLib.sol, L71: "Maximum" -> "Minimum".

27. Pool.sol: unused declaration OwnerWithdrawn(address indexed sender, int256 amount);.
28. PoolManager.sol, L27: it is recommended to include units as a variable name component, e.g., durationBlocks. Most variables have that, but not all.
29. : it is recommended to initialize important state variables in the constructor, e.g., the state is default because it is the first item in the list,

31. : since entropy depends on the value of , the return value of may vary depending on whether the pool is in the

    method return the zero address unless the pool is in the state. Alternatively, computing and storing the winner address at the pool
    completion time and having just return the stored value.
